      <p> <br>
        Nearly everyone I know has an explanation for Trump's victory: sexism,
        the media, racism, Comey, Clinton's own considerable flaws and failures,
        our perverse election system, the GOP's twenty year campaign of Clinton
        vilification … the list goes on and on. Every one of these explanations
        is valid. &nbsp;There are easily twenty reasons why Trump won and if
        there had been only eighteen, he probably wouldn't have made it. The
        technical term for this is 'luck'.</p>
      <p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">
        This is not to say that Trump's election was a random event. It reflects
        a whole host of problems with American politics, institutions, and
        culture. &nbsp;But the conjunction of so many <i></i>was&lt;.i&gt; a
        coincidence.It does <i>not</i> prove that Trump is some sort of rough
        hewn political genius.</p>
      <p> However, 'luck' has no place in our political or social discourse.
        &nbsp;Most Americans, including members of the news media, still hold to
        the quaint notion that all success is earned, one way or another.
        &nbsp;Since Trump won the election, it is presumed that he did something
        right: that he sensed the mood of the country, understood how to use the
        media, etc. &nbsp;But this is nonsense. &nbsp;The well documented limits
        of his attention span preclude such abstractions as tactics or strategy.
        &nbsp;It's probably wrong to imagine Trump really thinking through
        anything - his campaign appears to have been driven by his self-touted
        'intuition' and his uncontrolled mouth and tweets, and not much else.
        &nbsp;&nbsp;As it happened, his outbursts meshed with the prejudices,
        fears, and illusions of a critical number of voters in some critical
        states. &nbsp;In another year, with another opponent, at a different
        point in the business cycle, with a slightly more critical news media,
        etc., the outcome could easily have been different. &nbsp;Despite all
        his luck, the election really was quite close.</p>
      <p> Of course, in a well functioning democracy, elections shouldn't be a
        matter of luck. &nbsp;But a well functioning democracy is what we have.
        &nbsp;Both our methods of nominating and electing a president are a
        mess, and as it happens, both were at their worst this year. &nbsp;The
        convoluted, insanely expensive, and painfully protracted primary process
        yielded a choice between two historically unpopular candidates.
        &nbsp;Thanks to the electoral college (a vestige of concessions to
        eighteenth century slave owners), a minority of voters were able to
        impose a Trump on the rest of us.</p>
      <p> None of the factors that led to Trump's victory are new. &nbsp;Over
        the years, we've been warned about many of them. &nbsp;But, in the past,
        they didn't all come into play simultaneously - Fortuna was mostly on
        the side of sanity. &nbsp;This year was different. &nbsp;To use a tired
        but appropriate metaphor, the 2016 election was a perfect storm. Fortuna
        smiled on a reality show hack and <i>voila</i> a buffoon becomes the
        45th president of the U.S.</p>
