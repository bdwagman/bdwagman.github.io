          Nearly everyone I know has an explanation for Trump's victory: sexism,
          the media, racism, Comey, Clinton's own considerable flaws and
          failures, our perverse election system, the GOP's twenty year campaign
          of Clinton vilification … the list goes on and on. Every one of these
          explanations is valid. &nbsp;There are easily twenty reasons why Trump
          won and if there had been only eighteen, he probably wouldn't have
          made it. The technical term for this is 'luck'.</span></p>

          is not to say that Trump's election was a random event. &nbsp;It
          reflects a whole host of problems with American politics,
          institutions, and culture. &nbsp;But the conjunction of so many </span><span

          prove that Trump is some sort of rough hewn political genius.</span></p>

          'luck' has no place in our political or social discourse. &nbsp;Most
          Americans, including members of the news media, still hold to the
          quaint notion that all success is earned, one way or another.
          &nbsp;Since Trump won the election, it is presumed that he did
          something right: that he sensed the mood of the country, understood
          how to use the media, etc. &nbsp;But this is nonsense. &nbsp;The well
          documented limits of his attention span preclude such abstractions as
          tactics or strategy. &nbsp;It's probably wrong to imagine Trump really
          thinking through anything - his campaign appears to have been driven
          by his self-touted 'intuition' and his uncontrolled mouth and tweets,
          and not much else. &nbsp;&nbsp;As it happened, his outbursts meshed
          with the prejudices, fears, and illusions of a critical number of
          voters in some critical states. &nbsp;In another year, with another
          opponent, at a different point in the business cycle, with a slightly
          more critical news media, etc., the outcome could easily have been
          different. &nbsp;Despite all his luck, the election really was quite
          close.</span></p>

          course, in a well functioning democracy, elections shouldn't be a
          matter of luck. &nbsp;But a well functioning democracy is </span><span

          what we have. &nbsp;Both our methods of nominating and electing a
          president are a mess, and as it happens, both were at their worst this
          year. &nbsp;The convoluted, insanely expensive, and painfully
          protracted primary process yielded a choice between two historically
          unpopular candidates. &nbsp;Thanks to the electoral college (a vestige
          of concessions to eighteenth century slave owners), a minority of
          voters were able to impose a Trump on the rest of us.</span></p>

          of the factors that led to Trump's victory are new. &nbsp;Over the
          years, we've been warned about many of them. &nbsp;But, in the past,
          they didn't all come into play simultaneously - Fortuna was mostly on
          the side of sanity. &nbsp;This year was different. &nbsp;To use a
          tired but appropriate metaphor, the 2016 election was a perfect storm.
          Fortuna smiled on a reality show hack and </span><span style="font-size: 14.6667px; color: black; background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline;">voila</span><span
