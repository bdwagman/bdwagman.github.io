      <h1 style="text-align: center;">Our Lawful Coup</h1>
      <br>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Perhaps for the first time, the U.S. has a
        genuinely and thoroughly right wing government.&nbsp; With Trump in the
        White House and a post-Bush Republican Congress, all (non-judicial)
        power is in unambiguously far right hands.&nbsp; </p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Obviously, this doesn't mean the new
        government is united. &nbsp; There are plenty of factions and some were
        on exuberant display in the wrangling over health care.&nbsp; The
        American right has always had its divisions: isolationists versus
        interventionists, libertarians versus anti-choice Bible-thumpers,&nbsp;
        devotees of law and order versus Posse Comitatus.&nbsp; Add to the mix a
        president who exemplifies inconsistency and there's an enormous
        potential for 'debate'.&nbsp; But no matter how heated the arguments
        get, we need to remember that <em>all</em> the players are at one end
        of the political spectrum.&nbsp; No one to left of Barry Goldwater has
        any real say in policy.&nbsp; Just over a third of Americans identify
        themselves as conservatives; the rest of us are out of the game.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Our new government is the biggest
        political change since Reagan took office.&nbsp; However, <em>that</em>
        great leap to the right did seem to reflect a change in public
        sentiment.&nbsp; The election that brought conservatives to power in
        1980 was hardly a mandate: Reagan got 50.75% of the popular vote, the
        Republicans won the Senate but not the House.&nbsp; But there was, at
        the time, a sense that the majority of Americans wanted the country to
        take a more conservative tack.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">That is <em>not</em> true today.&nbsp;
        There is no indication that most voters wanted a right wing government,
        neither in last fall's voting nor in opinion polls. The Republicans did
        get a tiny plurality of the popular vote for House members, 48.7% to the
        Democrats 47.9%.&nbsp; But the Democrats won a majority of votes for
        senators (53.4%) and of course Clinton received several million more
        votes than Trump. The percentage of Americans who identify as
        conservative has been declining since 2009 and that trend has not
        changed.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">In other words, we have a drastic change
        in government that the majority of Americans don't want. It's an
        extraordinarily undemocratic result for a country that prides itself on
        being, well, a democracy.&nbsp; Between the shock of Trump's election
        and the ongoing shock of his twitter-tantrum presidency, this issue
        hasn't gotten much mention.&nbsp; It's worth considering how we got
        here.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Of course the electoral college is
        thoroughly undemocratic, but that isn't the only problem.&nbsp; In
        2010,&nbsp; Republicans launched a very aggressive and quite creative
        effort to get the most out of Congressional redistricting.&nbsp;
        Gerrymandering is nothing new in U.S. politics, but the Republican State
        Leadership Committee's "Redistricting Majority Project" (aka REDMAP)
        went beyond anything done in the past.&nbsp; The districts drawn after
        the 2010 census virtually guarantee Republican control of the
        House.&nbsp; (The poster child for contemporary gerrymandering is
        liberal Austin Texas, which was spread over<em> six </em>congressional
        districts; currently only<em> </em>one has a Democrat as
        Congressman).&nbsp; The House of Representatives is now <em>less</em>
        representative than the Senate, which was originally <em>designed</em>
        to be unrepresentative.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">There was nothing illegal about the
        Republican's mastery of redistricting nor about Trump's election.&nbsp;
        Illegal acts by Russian intelligence and the head of F.B.I. (perhaps the
        strangest bedfellows in the history of politics) may have manipulated
        public opinion in Trump's favor.&nbsp; But in the election itself, the
        rule of law prevailed.&nbsp; And that's what's so disturbing - that a
        lawfully conducted election could yield such undemocratic results.</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Nearly everyone is dissatisfied with state
        of American politics - it may be the only thing that conservatives and
        non-conservatives agree on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Nevertheless, we still think of
        the U.S. as an exemplar of democracy.&nbsp; Many Americans have a nearly
        religious reverence for the Constitution and like to see it as a perfect
        expression democratic principles.&nbsp; But of course we know that it
        really isn't</p>
      <p style="text-align: justify;">Large chunks of the Constitution were
        political concessions, designed to placate what were then the slave
        states.&nbsp; Slavery is gone, but the political mechanisms designed to
        protect it are still with us.&nbsp; The electoral college is the most
        obviously egregious example, but there are others.&nbsp; Managing
        federal<em> </em>elections is left to the<em> states</em>, and over the
        years some states have been very creative in using election rules to
        disenfranchise minorities.&nbsp; The Voting Rights Act was designed to
        end the worst abuses, but it has been weakened by conservative court
        rulings.&nbsp; Republicans have revitalized disenfranchisement with
        their campaign against non-existent voter fraud.&nbsp; The basis for
        undemocratic results is written into the Constitution.</p>
      <div style="text-align: justify;"> In the past, we've been lucky.&nbsp;
        Trump is only the fourth president to lose the popular vote. Prior to
        2010, majorities in the House have usually aligned with the majority of
        voters.&nbsp; So it's been easy to convince ourselves that we have a
        functioning democracy.&nbsp; But in 2016 our luck ran out. We have the
        worst case scenario: unrepresentative results for both the president and
        Congress.<br>
        <br>
        There's a standard high school civics class response to this complaint:
        if the majority of voters don't like, say, the Electoral College, they
        can replace it with something else.&nbsp; As a practical matter, that is
        nearly impossible. &nbsp; Even if the Republicans some how lost their
        control of the House, they could prevent reform at the state level. The
        thirteen smallest red states have less than 9% of the U.S. population
        but they are enough to block any constitutional amendment.&nbsp; As long
        the Republicans keep the loyalty of a strategically located tenth of the
        population, they prevent any election reform.<br>
        <br>
        When a government that is opposed by the majority of people takes power,
        we do not generally call that transition 'democratic'. The proper term
        for it is, of course, <em>coup d'etat.&nbsp; </em>A coup usually
        requires the apparatus of coercion - secret police, a military commanded
        by traitorous generals,&nbsp; paramilitary terror.&nbsp; We have none of
        those things in the U.S. but they aren't necessary. Here a coup can be
        achieved by lawful means.&nbsp; Some money, political consultants,
        organization, and most importantly the <em>law</em>, can be sufficient
        to impose a regime that does not rule by the consent of the
        governed.&nbsp; I suppose I have to quote the president: "sad".<br>
        <br>
        Like most Americans, I am reflexively optimistic.&nbsp; Positivity is a
        central element of our culture;&nbsp; I desperately want to find <em>something</em>
        hopeful to say about the current political situation.&nbsp; But it isn't
        easy.&nbsp; I suppose we could take some solace in the Republicans'
        failure to liquidate Obamacare, at least for now.&nbsp; Perhaps the
        GOP's dysfunction and the president's sheer incompetence will keep the
        government gridlocked for a while. Perhaps the courts will continue to
        block the president's most bigoted inclinations - at least until Trump
        starts filling&nbsp; judicial vacancies.&nbsp; The case for hope is
        pretty thin. <br>
        <br>
        Most Americans already have an unfavorable view the new administration
        and it's notional allies in Congress, but so what? It will be at least
        two years before anything can change, and the damage that can be done
        before then is unimaginable. The president's and the Republicans'
        approval ratings may continue to fall.&nbsp; Their faint legitimacy may
        grow still dimmer.&nbsp; Ultimately,&nbsp; <em>power</em> is more
        important than legitimacy.&nbsp; Today, all power is in the hands of our
        most right wing politicians.&nbsp; I do not think that they will
        hesitate to use it, regardless of what the majority of Americans want.<br>
