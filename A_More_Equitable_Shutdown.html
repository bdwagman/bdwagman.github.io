      <h2 style="   text-align: center;">A More Equitable Shutdown</h2>
      <br>
      <br>
      With infections increasing across the country, there really is no longer
      any doubt: our attempts to reopen the country safely have failed. This is
      not a surprise. As states started reopening in early May, experts were
      expressing concern.&nbsp; Their warnings were duly reported and largely
      ignored.&nbsp; Our patchwork of testing and tracing is simply inadequate
      to control the spread of the coronavirus. We will need more
      shutdowns.&nbsp; But for the next round of shutdowns to be effective, they
      need to be more equitable than the first ones were.<br>
      <br>
      The initial shutdowns were a hardship for all Americans but of course the
      pain was not equally shared.&nbsp; The millions who lost their jobs
      suffered much more than the rest of us.&nbsp; We all suffered
      psychologically but many of the unemployed ended up in lines at food banks
      and in fear of eviction.&nbsp; There's not much we can do about the
      personal anguish, but the economic suffering can be reduced. If we are
      going to prevent tens of thousands of more deaths, we need to ensure that
      all Americans can afford to stay home. <br>
      <br>
      This is a moral imperative but also a practical one.&nbsp; The worst hit
      states were able to lower infection and death rates because most people
      complied with shutdown rules.&nbsp; It will be harder to get compliance
      with the next round of shutdowns if people aren't confident that they can
      economically survive them.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      The first round of relief measures relied heavily on existing government
      programs. This was a sensible way to get aid out quickly and these
      measures certainly helped millions of people.&nbsp; But they were also a
      source of enormous frustration and anxiety.&nbsp; Getting unemployment
      benefits was a protracted bureaucratic nightmare for many Americans.&nbsp;
      Some people waited <em>months</em> to get benefits - not a small matter
      if you've been living paycheck to paycheck.&nbsp; Like our coronavirus
      testing 'system', the mechanism for approving unemployment benefits is an
      underfunded patchwork.&nbsp; A system of direct payments to citizens would
      probably work better and instill more confidence.<br>
      <br>
      Whatever form relief measures take, we will have to spend a lot of money
      and it will have to be debt financed.&nbsp; Fortunately, we can afford
      it.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      Contrary to conservative harping about 'big government',&nbsp; federal
      spending (as a share of GDP)&nbsp; is roughly the same as it was in
      1980.&nbsp; Excluding transfer payments, federal spending has been <em>declining</em>
      for over half a century. <br>
      <br>
      To see what really large government spending looks like, we need to look
      back to the 1940s. Federal spending and borrowing reached their peaks
      during World War II.&nbsp;&nbsp; At the height of the war, the federal
      budget was nearly a third of GDP and the deficit was 27%.&nbsp; By
      comparison, in 2019 the deficit was 4.6% of GDP.&nbsp; What did the World
      War II debt do to the postwar economy?&nbsp; Did it economically cripple
      future generations?&nbsp; Exactly the opposite.&nbsp; During the two
      decades after World War II, the U.S. economy had very strong economic
      growth, possibly the strongest in our history. Perhaps the World War II
      level of deficits could not have been maintained indefinitely.&nbsp; But
      four years of large scale borrowing had no negative effects.&nbsp; So the
      World War II deficits are a good indicator of what's fiscally feasible.<br>
      <br>
      The Congressional Budget Office currently estimates the 2020 deficit at 4%
      of GDP.&nbsp; To get the deficit to World War II levels, we'd need to
      spend another 4.9 trillion dollars, almost 2 trillion more that the relief
      package recently passed by the House of Representatives.<br>
      <br>
      In other words, a large relief package is imminently feasible and should
      have no negative effect on the economy, now or in the future.&nbsp; There
      is no non-ideological reason not to implement one.&nbsp; With sufficient
      spending, we can make the next round of shutdowns economically tolerable
      for all Americans.&nbsp; It's the right thing to do and it's necessary if
      we want to limit sickness and deaths from covid-19. <br>
