      Can an entire institution be masochistic?&nbsp; While Donald Trump
      continues his increasingly shrill attacks on the media, it continues its
      (presumably unintentional) efforts to legitimize him as a presidential
      candidate.&nbsp; Trump, we're told, has harnessed the anger of&nbsp;
      blue-collar Republicans voters, long neglected by the GOP
      establishment.&nbsp;&nbsp; He is praised (albeit grudgingly) for his
      success at getting free media and running a campaign on a low budget. He
      is hailed as the master of the news cycle. And reporters are hard at work
      deciphering his positions on issues.<br>
      <br>
      But of course this is all nonsense.&nbsp; Trump doesn't <i>have</i> real
      positions on issues.&nbsp; He didn't snare free media, it was given to
      him.&nbsp; Overall, Trump's success has almost nothing to do with anything
      he has intentionally done.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      The media's current Trump coverage reflects a common American
      misconception: that success is always earned. It's a charming notion and
      about as realistic as the tooth fairy. Since Trump has captured the
      Republican nomination, by this logic he must have done something to
      deserve it.&nbsp; Having failed to predict his nomination, reporters and
      commentators are now scrambling to identify what Trump did right.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      In fact, Trump's success is almost entirely a matter of luck - something
      that our culture tends not to acknowledge (except in casinos).&nbsp; His
      success does reflect problems in our political system, the Republican
      Party, the Conservative movement, and the news media.&nbsp; But it's wrong
      to think that Trump understands any of this.&nbsp; He just happened to be
      at the wrong place at the wrong time, with a very big mouth.<br>
      <br>
      How has Trump been lucky? Let us count the ways.<br>
      <br>
      The Republican field of presidential candidates was very large, but it was
      also very weak.&nbsp; Go through the list one by one - you won't find a
      single candidate who wasn't seriously flawed.&nbsp; Kasich wasn't
      conservative enough for the base and, well, pretty dull.&nbsp; Cruz was
      plenty conservative but almost universally detested.&nbsp; Carson was
      clueless.&nbsp; Bush was yet <i>another </i>Bush, something no one
      wanted.&nbsp; You can fill in the rest.&nbsp; In truth, Trump beat a field
      of losers.<br>
      <br>
      In 2014, the RNC increased the number of winner take all primaries,
      shortening nomination process to help the front runner.&nbsp; And it
      worked.&nbsp; After the last contested primary, Trump had 54% of the
      chosen delegates but only 40% of the popular vote.&nbsp;&nbsp; Without the
      rule change, the convention would almost certainly have been contested.<br>
      <br>
      For decades, the GOP has catered to a wide range of bigotries, making
      itself the home and haven for racists, the anti-immigrant set, conspiracy
      theorists, etc.&nbsp; As many people have noted, Trump is the embodiment
      of these world views.<br>
      <br>
      While the conservative movement remains politically powerful, it is in
      fact intellectually bankrupt.&nbsp; Since the 1980s, when conservatives
      effectively took control of U.S. politics, nearly all of their policies
      have been tried, from the War on Drugs and the destruction of the social
      safety net to militarized foreign policy and deregulated finance.&nbsp; By
      and large, these policies have failed, and on some level, everyone knows
      it. But conservative leaders have nothing else to offer.&nbsp; Hence the
      disillusionment of their supporters.&nbsp; But for many of these people,
      conservatism has an almost religious status, so a shift away from the
      right is inconceivable.&nbsp; Hence the appeal of someone, anyone, who
      claims to be conservative but is offering something that sounds different
      - even if it doesn't actually make any sense.&nbsp; The less sense, the
      better, since a coherent conservative platform would just be more of
      same.&nbsp; Trump visceral conservatism, replete with the full set of
      biases but to real logic, is a perfect fit.&nbsp; <br>
      <br>
      But Trump's greatest luck has been the news media, which really deserves
      most of the blame.&nbsp; Since early in the campaign, the amount of
      coverage Trump received has been absolutely unprecedented.&nbsp; He has
      been a top story nearly every day for months. The value of free media he
      received <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/upshot/measuring-donald-trumps-mammoth-advantage-in-free-media.html?_r=1">has








        been estimated at nearly two billion dollars</a> (and that's just
      through February). (<a href="http://www.people-press.org/2016/03/31/1-views-of-the-primaries-press-coverage-of-candidates-attitudes-about-government-and-the-country/">Three








        quarters of Americans think he has gotten too much coverage</a>.)&nbsp;
      <br>
      <br>
      And all this attention has taken nearly no effort on Trump's part.&nbsp;
      The pattern has become as predictable as it is annoying.&nbsp; Trump says
      or tweets whatever is on his mind, which is invariably offensive,
      outrageous, and/or nonsensical.&nbsp; Based on entertainment value, it get
      disseminated around the internet and by the evening it's a top story in
      all the major news sources.&nbsp; All Trump has to do is continue being
      himself, and the media does the rest.<br>
      <br>
      The fact that reporters are often critical of Trump is irrelevant.
      Presumably Trump fans are inclined to be hostile to the news media, so the
      <i>nature</i> of the coverage isn't important. It's the quantity that
      matters.&nbsp;&nbsp; The enormous amount of reporting on Trump has gotten
      his 'message' out to far more people than he could ever have reached
      himself.&nbsp; And his constant presence in the news made him <i>seem</i>
      important long before he started getting votes.<br>
      <br>
      Of course the news media needed to cover Trump, but it didn't need him <i>so</i>
      much attention. All that attention is mostly a function of the media's
      predilections.&nbsp; Trump is an easy story.&nbsp; No boring excursions
      into policy details, no 'nuanced' analysis, just an endless cycle of
      simple, provocative statements and the inevitable response. There is also
      an economic factor at play.&nbsp; As CBS' CEO said, the Trump coverage <a
        href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/les-moonves-donald-trump_us_56d52ce8e4b03260bf780275">“...

        may not be good for America, but it’s damn good for CBS</a>.<br>
      <br>
      Perhaps reporters and editors are having buyers remorse, but like Dr. F,
      there really isn't anything they can do to get the monster they unleashed
      under control.&nbsp; Less coverage is no longer an option.&nbsp; Critical
      coverage just fans the flames.&nbsp; At this point, we can only hope that
      the villagers do the right thing and take matters into their own hands in
      November.<br>
