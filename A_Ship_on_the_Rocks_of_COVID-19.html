      <h2 align="center"> A Ship on the Rocks of COVID-19</h2>
      <br>
      <p> If we are very lucky, a credible vaccine for coronavirus will be
        widely available within a year or so. In the meantime, COVID-19 will
        sicken and kill many more Americans. &nbsp;Some fairly obvious actions
        could still reduce the number of casualties. &nbsp;Other countries have
        taken these actions - the U.S. will not. &nbsp;It's worth understanding
        why. </p>
      <p> The proximate reason is, of course, President Trump, who seems
        committed to doing virtually nothing to mitigate the pandemic. Congress
        could pass legislation to force his hand, but Senate Republicans seem
        firm in their support for his inaction. &nbsp;But there is also a
        broader problem. &nbsp;A majority of Americans would probably support
        more actions to control the pandemic. &nbsp;In a democracy, a single
        obstinate fool, even if he's the president, should not be able to thwart
        the public's will. &nbsp;But that's exactly what's happening.
        &nbsp;Beyond the president's self-centered obstinacy lies the broad
        failure of our political system.</p>
      <p> Before considering how our system is failing, let' s review the
        actions that we could be taking to reduce the damage from COVID-19.
        They're pretty obvious.</p>
      <p> (i) Testing and tracing need to be increased to much higher levels
        (comparable to, say, the levels reached in S. Korea). This needs to be
        done in the entire country. &nbsp;Our patchwork of state programs have
        clearly failed. &nbsp;Testing and tracing need to be mandated, regulated
        and funded by the federal government.<br>
        (ii) Shutdowns need to be reimposed systematically. &nbsp;Both shutdowns
        and reopenings should be based on objective criteria formulated by
        people with scientific expertise - these decisions clearly cannot be
        left to politicians. &nbsp;We need one set of standards for the country.
        &nbsp;State boundaries are irrelevant to viral transmission, so shutdown
        and reopening orders must be applied to regions that make scientific
        sense.&nbsp; <br>
        (iii) We need to ensure that all Americans can <em>afford</em> to
        comply with shutdown orders. &nbsp;The first round of shutdowns imposed
        enormous economic hardship. All Americans must have enough income to
        survive the unemployment that shutdowns inevitably bring. &nbsp;This
        could be accomplished by extending existing programs like unemployment
        insurance and SNAP, but it's probably more effective to directly ensure
        a minimum monthly income for the duration of the pandemic.<br>
        (iv) In essential industries like food processing, OSHA needs to impose<span
          class="c1">&nbsp;regulations to reduce the risk of transmission among
          workers.</span></p>
      <p> Besides being obvious, these actions are imminently feasible.
        &nbsp;They would take a lot of money and will need to be debt financed
        but this is really not a problem - the <a href="A_More_Equitable_Shutdown.html">historical
          record</a> clearly shows that we can afford much larger federal
        deficits without any damage to the economy, now or in the future.</p>
      <p> There are, however, a whole set of political problems that will
        prevent seriously fighting the coronavirus, no matter what most
        Americans want.</p>
      <p> Unlike nearly all other democracies, the U.S. has no way to quickly
        change our leaders. &nbsp;We have no means to bring down a government.
        &nbsp;There is no way to call a snap election or (at the federal level)
        to have a recall referendum. &nbsp;If Trump is defeated in the next
        election, he will not actually be replaced until late in January of
        2021, so we have at least another half year of his inaction.</p>
      <p> It's likely that the majority of Americans will vote against Trump in
        November but of course that does not mean he won't be re-elected.
        &nbsp;After all, the majority of us voted against him four years ago.
        &nbsp;Thanks to the perversity of the Electoral College, the next
        president will be chosen by voters in a handful of states, as usual.</p>
      <p> If Trump is replaced, serious actions to control COVID-19 could be
        blocked by a Republican Senate. &nbsp;In the last two elections,
        Democrats won the majority of all votes cast in Senate races but the GOP
        maintained control. &nbsp;This could easily happen again. Although we
        rarely notice, the Senate is in fact an inherently undemocratic
        institution. &nbsp;With its six year, overlapping terms, changing
        control of the Senate is a slow and difficult process, particularly
        because of Republican strength in a number of small states. &nbsp;The
        Democrats could once again win the popular vote and not gain control of
        Congress.</p>
      <p> If, in January 2021, we have a president and a Congress that want to
        take serious steps to control COVID-19, they will still have the courts
        to contend with. &nbsp;Since effective efforts to control the pandemic
        require federal action, conservatives are likely to challenge them in
        the courts (many conservatives <em>hate</em> the federal government
        doing anything other than fight wars). &nbsp;At present, federal courts
        are dominated by conservative judges and four members of the Supreme
        Court consistently vote based on right wing ideology. &nbsp;As a
        practical matter, federal courts have almost unlimited power and are
        subject to no democratic control. Even if court challenges do not
        prevail, they are likely to produce deadly delays.</p>
      <p> This is not to say that a Democratic victory in November wouldn't save
        lives. &nbsp;But our political system will have delayed action to
        control COVID-19 and it provides conservatives many opportunities to
        hamper those actions.</p>
      <p> Although almost no one is happy with the state of American politics,
        our political system is still often portrayed as the exemplar of
        democracy (at least by Americans). &nbsp;An almost religious reverence
        for the constitution is common among our chattering class. Every two
        years when elections roll around, supposedly hard headed reporters get
        dewy-eyed about our 'great exercise in democracy'. &nbsp;It's time to
        get over it. &nbsp;The constitution was not handed down on Mount Sinai.
        &nbsp;It is not a pure expression of the wisdom of the country's
        founders - much of it represents nothing more than political deals.
        &nbsp;It was a great advance in democracy back in 1789 but it's flaws
        have matured into a legalistic, convoluted, undemocratic mess. &nbsp;Our
        vaunted political system is a ship on the rocks and out of control. We
        cannot steer it, not even to save our own lives.</p>
