      <h2 style="   text-align: center;">COVID-Relief: We Can Spend <em>Much</em>
        More</h2>
      <br>
      <div align="justify"><br>
        Are we really spending a lot on COVID-19 relief? By conventional
        standards, it might seem so. According to the Congressional Budget
        Office, Congress has allocated 2.5 trillion dollars to mitigate the
        economic effects of the pandemic, roughly 12% of last year's GDP. That
        is certainly enormous compared to recent relief programs - an order of
        magnitude greater than the federal response to Hurricane Katrina or the
        2008 recession.</div>
      <div align="justify"><br>
      </div>
      <div align="justify">
        <div align="justify">But the response to recent disasters is the wrong
          standard. The current recession will probably be the worst since the
          1930s and COVID-19 is certainly the greatest threat to the U.S.
          population since World War II. The 1940s war effort is a better
          example of what a really large government response looks like. And
          it's a good indicator of what's possible.<br>
          <br>
          In the year after Pearl Harbor, federal spending rose by nearly 150%,
          an increase equal to 18% of pre-war GDP. And that was just the first
          year. At the peak of wartime spending, the federal budget equaled 44%
          of GDP. (Coming out of the Great Depression, all that government
          spending drastically increased national output. In 1944, federal
          spending was 66% of real pre-war GDP.)<br>
        </div>
        <br>
      </div>
      <div align="justify">To pay for the war effort, the government borrowed
        and borrowed a lot. At its peak in 1944, the federal deficit equaled 26%
        of GDP. All that debt financed spending was undoubtedly needed to win
        the war. But what did it do to the postwar economy? Did it economically
        cripple future generations? Exactly the opposite. During the two decades
        after World War II, the U.S. economy had strong economic growth,
        possibly the strongest in our history - certainly stronger than we've
        seen in the last two decades. The World War II level of government
        borrowing probably could not have been maintained indefinitely. But four
        years of large scale borrowing had no negative effect.<br>
        <br>
        Notwithstanding current attempts to 'reopen' the economy, stay at home
        orders are likely to be needed for quite a while - possibly until an
        effective vaccine is developed <i>and</i> produced in large quantities.
        This will continue to cause enormous hardship, especially for the
        millions who have lost their jobs. The personal and psychological
        hardship may be unavoidable, but the economic hardship isn't. We can
        make staying at home economically tolerable if we act on a large enough
        scale. To take the most obvious example, Americans should not have to
        turn to food banks to survive. This is a problem that more relief
        spending can directly solve. <br>
        <br>
        To manage a large-scale relief program, some institutional changes would
        be helpful. Our current patchwork of programs probably needs to be
        replaced (or at least supplemented) by something more systematic. To
        manage the enormous production needed to fight World War II, the
        government had to take substantial control of the economy, via a
        specially created (and temporary) agency, called the War Production
        Board. There's no reason, well, no <i>non-political</i> reason, why we
        couldn't have something like that to administer a large-scale relief
        program and to ensure that there are no more shortages of essential
        supplies. (Given the state of the current administration, we probably
        need an agency with independence comparable to that of the Federal
        Reserve.)<br>
        <br>
        Fighting COVID-19 may not take as great an effort as defeating fascism,
        but we should be prepared to make an effort of that scale. If the U.S.
        could afford it in 1942, after twelve years of the Great Depression, we
        can certainly afford it now.</div>
