      </h2>
      <p><br>
        The news media still doesn't quite understand Bernie Sanders' campaign
        for president.&nbsp; For quite awhile, Sanders was politely dismissed as
        a protest candidate and treated with benign neglect.&nbsp; After Iowa
        and New Hampshire, that no longer works, so Sander's success has been
        integrated into the central 'narrative' of the primary campaign: that
        voters are angry at Washington and have turned to 'outsiders' who are
        more 'genuine' than 'establishment' candidates.&nbsp; This has been
        media's take on the Republicans for quite a while, and they've&nbsp; now
        extended it to the Democrats.&nbsp; It's neat, simple, and exactly the
        kind of story reporters and editors love - politics as an expression of
        the voters' emotions (with issues and policies as a
        sideline).&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>And</i> it satisfies the media's compulsion
        for political symmetry (a subject we'll return to). </p>
      <p> Of course this is mostly nonsense.&nbsp; Both parties are having
        rather tumultuous primary campaigns, but they are facing very different
        kinds of tumult. The current states of the two parties are completely
        different.&nbsp; To understand what's going on in a less superficial
        way, we need to take a little history into account, a bit more than is
        usually applied to politics.&nbsp; <br>
      </p>
      <p> After thirty years, the conservative era may be drawing to a
        close.&nbsp; This has left the Republican Party in an anomalous and
        uncomfortable position.&nbsp; In many respects, the GOP has rarely had
        more power: they control the both branches of government in twenty-four
        states, both houses of Congress, and a good chunk of the judiciary.
        &nbsp; And, although it's rarely acknowledged, over the last few decades
        the U.S. has tried nearly all the policies that conservatives love, from
        the War on Drugs, to a militarized foreign policy and deregulated
        finance. Unfortunately, most of these policies have failed and public
        support for them is eroding.&nbsp; Conservatives really have nothing
        else to offer, but aren't willing to give up.&nbsp; So, they've doubled
        down, advancing increasingly extreme versions of their basic right wing
        agenda.&nbsp; </p>
      <p> In fact, among the (many) Republican candidates, there is very little
        difference in policy.&nbsp; The 'outsider' and 'establishment'
        candidates may differ in their rhetoric, but their positions on issues
        are just minor variations on the general conservative theme. (Trump is a
        bit of exception, but of course his candidacy is based entirely on
        attitude - issues are an afterthought.)&nbsp; The Republican campaign
        may be personally contentious, but in terms of policy, the GOP is
        strikingly united. </p>
      <p> The Democrats' situation is just the opposite.&nbsp; Throughout the
        conservative era, they have been dominated by the 'centrists' (aka
        moderate conservatives) of the Democratic Leadership Council and
        similarly inclined Democrats (like President Obama).&nbsp; Hillary
        Clinton is a long time member of this wing of the party, and her
        candidacy represents a continuation of its policies.&nbsp;</p>
      <p> However, over the last decade, the Democrats liberal wing of has
        gained some strength, especially among Democratic voters (less so among
        elected officials).&nbsp;&nbsp; And Bernie Sanders is running on a
        platform of 'progressive' (aka liberal) policies (propelled by some
        slightly left wing rhetoric). </p>
      <p> In other words, thanks to Sanders, Democrats have a real choice:
        continue as a center-right party or shift (moderately) to the
        left.&nbsp;&nbsp; And that's the key to understanding what's important
        in this election.&nbsp; U.S. presidential campaigns are usually
        dominated by fights between personalities, and that's the kind of
        campaign the Republican are having (albeit a bit more theatrically than
        usual).&nbsp; But Bernie Sanders' campaign really isn't about Bernie at
        all, it about his platform.&nbsp; For the first time in a generation or
        more, U.S. voters are getting a chance to vote for policies that are
        thoroughly non-conservative. <br>
      </p>
      <p> No wonder Hillary is getting flustered, and that the news media has
        misconstrued Bernie.&nbsp; They (reasonably) expected a normal contest,
        a competition based on competing personalities.&nbsp; Instead,&nbsp;
        against all expectations and the conventional wisdom, <i>issues</i> are
        driving the Democratic campaign.&nbsp; Although no one seems to have
        noticed, Democratic voters are deciding whether to change the future
        course of their party and, conceivably, the nation as a whole. </p>
